0
00:00:00 --> 00:00:26


1
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:46,899
Outta the way!

2
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,339
Here they come.

3
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,384
Philippe, 100 euros
says I can lose them.

4
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,345
- Philippe.
- You're on.

5
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,013
Here we go.

6
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,289
You're in shape. God!

7
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,384
Shit!

8
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,012
Fuck!

9
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,180
So you lost them?

10
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,891
Get out! Hands on the hood!

11
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,603
- Get out!
- Two hundred says I get an escort.

12
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,396
You'll lose again.

13
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,106
- Two hundred, an escort!
- You're on.

14
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,816
Let's see your hands!

15
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,526
Your goddamn hands!

16
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,653
Let me explain.

17
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,865
Shut your mouth
and put your hands on the hood!

18
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,033
Hold on.

19
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,370
- Let go!
- I said get out!

20
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,039
He can't get out!

21
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,665
He can't even open the door!

22
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,918
- What?
- Look at the sticker!

23
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,545
There's a wheelchair in the trunk!

24
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,088
Go and check!

25
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,673
Take a look.

26
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,300
Let go of me.

27
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:39,803
Yeah.

28
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,513
Well?

29
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,057
What is this?

30
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,185
You think I drive that fast
for the hell of it?

31
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,187
We're heading for the hospital.

32
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,314
He's having a fit, OK.

33
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,774
It's an emergency!

34
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,943
He can't move! I'm his caregiver.

35
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,653
We have a problem.

36
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,529
Look.

37
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,534
What do we do?

38
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,120
Know what? Think it over.
Take your time.

39
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,666
Then call his kid and say
you killed her dad!

40
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,126
In five minutes, he'll be a goner,

41
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,836
dead as a dodo.

42
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,213
So take your time.

43
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,260
Go on, think it over!
While he croaks.

44
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,595
OK, get going.

45
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,028
- Where are you heading?
- The ER.

46
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,155
We'll escort you, it's safer.

47
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,658
We're escorting them. Let's go!

48
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,955
It's OK, they're splitting.

49
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,292
This is really gross, Philippe.

50
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,712
Freaks me out.
How do you produce this stuff?

51
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,132
Maybe you should take
that driving test now.

52
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,552
Yes, but for now,
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

53
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,178
An escort at 200 euros.

54
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,639
I never wager such large sums.

55
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,225
This calls for a change of mood.

56
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,061
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

57
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,356
Come on, I helped you out.

58
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,276
Philippe, the escort.

59
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,862
The escort, it's safer.

60
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,199
We'll escort you, it's safer!

61
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,378
Here he comes.

62
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,091
They're bringing a stretcher.
You'll be OK?

63
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,884
- Yes, fine.
- Good luck.

64
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,052
Goodbye.

65
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,611
What do we do now?

66
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,197
You let me handle it now.

67
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,474
Any references?

68
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,684
Yes, I have a DAHC,

69
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,812
a Diploma in Advanced Home Care.

70
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,068
I backed it up with training
at the Bayer Institute in 2001.

71
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,195
I studied social work at school,

72
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,782
then did a course
in social and family economics.

73
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,409
Actually, the thing is...

74
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,995
I've done more studying
than working.

75
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,706
What is your key motivation?

76
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,708
Money.

77
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,835
The man.

78
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,088
I'm totally into that.

79
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,839
That's nice.

80
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,050
Helping others, I think.

81
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,427
Is that OK? Did I get it right?

82
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,346
The neighborhood.

83
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,390
I like crippled people,

84
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,058
since I was little.

85
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,895
Working to make the handicapped
independent,

86
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,230
on a social level.

87
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,899
Sport too. You need to move.

88
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,694
To fit in with life.

89
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,238
These people can't do a thing.

90
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,032
I had
my first professional experience...

91
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,285
That was Mrs. Dupont-Moretti...

92
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,662
A very old lady...

93
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,748
...really very old...

94
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,378
...whom I cared for until the end.

95
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,423
There were fun times
in the geriatric unit

96
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,049
at Halloween and so on.

97
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,387
I'm also an expert
with bureaucracy.

98
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,348
Housing grants, for instance.

99
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,100
I don't know. Maybe...

100
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,603
...you get one?

101
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,772
Check, Magalie,
but somehow I doubt it.

102
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,741
- Yvan Laprade?
- Yes.

103
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:16,908
Enough.

104
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,661
- I'm Laprade.
- I'm sick of waiting.

105
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,918
Hello.

106
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,420
I need a signature.

107
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,548
Have a seat.

108
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,597
Any references?

109
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,725
- I have plenty.
- All right.

110
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,560
We're listening.

111
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,521
Kool and the Gang,
Earth, Wind & Fire.

112
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,231
Good references?

113
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,526
I don't know them. Sit down.

114
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,279
You know nothing about music.

115
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,366
I'm no ignoramus
when it comes to music

116
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,576
even if I don't know Cruel...

117
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,745
- Kool and the Gang.
- And you?

118
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,498
Do you know Chopin,
Schubert or Berlioz?

119
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,750
Do I know Berlioz?

120
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,919
I bet you don't!

121
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,213
I'm a specialist.

122
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,381
Oh yeah?

123
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,800
Who do you know there?

124
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,469
Which building?

125
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,471
What do you mean?

126
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,265
Before becoming a housing project,

127
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,228
Berlioz was a 19th century composer,
writer and critic.

128
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:30,482
Bullshit. I know who Berlioz is.
Humor's like music for you.

129
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,777
You suck at both.

130
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,615
You need a signature?

131
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,706
Yeah, to say
I applied for the job...

132
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,000
...but that despite
my obvious qualities...

133
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,587
Just put the usual spiel
about not being interested.

134
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,424
I need three refusals
to get the benefit.

135
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,676
I see, your benefit.

136
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,386
Any other motivations?

137
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,554
Yes, plenty.

138
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,640
One right here.

139
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,684
Very motivating in fact.

140
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,731
OK, I'm having a blast,
but what do we do?

141
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,982
Sign or not?

142
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,443
I can't sign right now.

143
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,778
- Why not?
- Why not?

144
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,875
That's a bummer.

145
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,878
I'm already late handing it in.

146
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,630
That's a bummer as you say.

147
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:41,219
- Can't Ms. Motivation sign for you?
- Magalie isn't authorized.

148
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,434
Too bad, she could have added
her cell number.

149
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,312
Pick it up tomorrow at nine.

150
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,939
I'd hate to deprive you
of your benefit.

151
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,483
I won't see you out.

152
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,276
No, don't get up.

153
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,904
I mean, stay seated.

154
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,281
I'll come back tomorrow.

155
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,869
Mina, is she here?

156
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,538
No, she'll be back late.

157
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,629
No!

158
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,466
Turn the tap off
or I don't have any water!

159
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:02,801
Turn the tap off!

160
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,594
Get out of here!

161
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,096
I'm taking a shower!

162
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,889
- Leave me be!
- Out!

163
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,850
Get them out.

164
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,017
Go on.

165
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,019
Bintou, I'm serious!

166
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,187
Mina!

167
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,064
Get them out!

168
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,941
Get out with your big belly.

169
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,442
Let go!

170
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,027
Get out!

171
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,362
Out, you lot!

172
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,822
Get it?

173
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,949
- Hey, Bintou.
- Let go!

174
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,784
Bintou, what the hell?

175
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,619
Sit down, you!

176
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,057
- Where were you?
- At school.

177
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,938
Where are you going?

178
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,523
Horse-riding.

179
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,691
Wise guy.

180
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,731
Here, it's for you.

181
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,818
Where were you?

182
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,947
On vacation.

183
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,116
People talk around here.

184
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,202
You think I'm a dumb bitch?

185
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,245
Six months without seeing you.

186
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,289
Not one phone call.
Nothing!

187
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,084
And now you turn up
with a Kinder egg?

188
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,587
You think your scams
will pay for the rent,

189
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,838
for food?

190
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,844
You think this is a hotel?

191
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,139
Look at me when I talk to you!

192
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,726
Idiot!

193
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,688
There's no talking to you!

194
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,981
Want to talk?

195
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,361
I'm listening.

196
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,910
I'm listening.

197
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,790
You know, Driss,

198
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,292
I've done a lot of praying for you.

199
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,295
But, God forgive me,

200
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,672
I have other children.

201
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,426
I still have hope for them.

202
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,347
I don't want you coming back here.

203
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:59,144
Just pack up your bags
and get the hell out.

204
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,520
Is that clear?

205
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,565
Get out.

206
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,484
Get out!

207
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,106
That was a good one, right?

208
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,484
Know what? I'm going.

209
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,361
- It wasn't funny?
- Forget it.

210
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,071
It wasn't funny?

211
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,920
<i>- Yes?</i>
- It's for my paper.

212
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,047
<i>- I was expecting you.</i>
- About...

213
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,800
<i>- Come in.</i>
...my benefit.

214
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,062
Tell Philippe he's here.

215
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,607
Right away.

216
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,071
Well?

217
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,782
No beetroot,
but the radishes are nearly ready.

218
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:00,909
Good.

219
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,076
Hello.

220
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,627
Come along.

221
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,089
I'm warning you, he had a bad night.

222
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,592
Like you apparently.

223
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,971
His day begins at 7:00 a.m.
With the nurse.

224
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,058
He needs two to three hours of care
each morning.

225
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,853
Many applicants throw in the towel
after a week.

226
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,438
We see a lot of them.

227
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,735
I like the decor,
the music and all the rest,

228
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,821
but I'm not buying
and I have stuff to do.

229
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,492
I was told to show you around.

230
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,118
Anyhow, it's nearly over.

231
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:47,538
To communicate,
you have a baby monitor.

232
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,666
It's like a walkie-talkie.

233
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:54,128
Under the terms of the contract,
you have your own quarters.

234
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,880
This is the toilet.

235
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,552
And you have a separate bathroom.

236
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:07,934
This way.

237
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,867
He's expecting you.

238
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,160
Just a minute.

239
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,757
I had your paper signed.

240
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,176
It's on the table over there.

241
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,185
So you like being assisted?

242
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,062
What?

243
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,481
You don't mind
living off others' backs?

244
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,650
It's not a problem for you?

245
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,278
No. How about you?

246
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:07,744
Do you think you're capable of working?
With constraints, regular hours,

247
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,078
responsibilities...

248
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,913
A sense of humor after all.

249
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,751
And I'm ready to try you out
for a month.

250
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,211
You have a day to think it over.

251
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,215
I bet you won't last two weeks.

252
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,829
What?

253
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,247
<i>No bone,</i>

254
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,292
no muscle should be ignored.
Move them all.

255
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,545
Keep the skin and joints
in good condition.

256
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,966
To do that,
you need to be meticulous,

257
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,387
and strict.
All right? Is that clear?

258
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,263
Wake up!

259
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,890
You sleep at night!

260
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,141
I'm not asleep.

261
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,351
Help me.

262
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,437
Let's put Philippe in his chair...

263
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,315
...and get him to the shower.

264
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,276
I know...

265
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,904
Try it on your own. Show me.

266
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,163
Don't be scared. Go on.

267
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,748
I'm not scared.

268
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,303
Happy now?

269
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,433
Never let him go
until he's strapped in.

270
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,310
Yes, I'm kinky that way.

271
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,312
No one told me.

272
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,233
I'm in training.

273
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,196
Do you want white gloves or what?
Scrub away!

274
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,241
The shampoo's weird,
it won't lather.

275
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,035
- How's it going?
- It won't lather.

276
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:14,871
What?

277
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,331
I don't believe it.

278
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,709
That's his foot cream.

279
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,335
Hold on.

280
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,589
Don't tell me you can't read, Driss!

281
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,923
Sure I can, but...

282
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,134
You seem pretty gifted.

283
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,220
Usually it's one for the whole body.

284
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,555
This guy has 20.

285
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm not spending all day here.

286
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:36,893
This one then?

287
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,728
The one marked shampoo.

288
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,231
Will you manage?

289
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,983
Of course he will.

290
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,777
My feet are beautifully coiffed.

291
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,363
Go and have lunch, Marcelle.

292
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,367
Where's the skirt?

293
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:57,997
They're support stockings.
They help the blood to flow properly

294
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,373
so I don't faint.

295
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,670
I'm not doing that.

296
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,215
There's a problem here.

297
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,717
Seeing as how I won't be doing it,

298
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,262
we need to see if...
Marcelle!

299
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,141
Maybe Marcelle could come back
to put them on you.

300
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:21,270
She knows how to do it,
being a chick and all that...

301
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,773
I'm just not doing it, OK.

302
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,650
You're better off fainting.

303
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,401
I mean, sometimes...

304
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,404
We just refuse to put them on.
We're men.

305
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,781
No way, Marcelle!

306
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,293
You're good with stockings.

307
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,296
Only natural with that cute earring.

308
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,757
Can we cut the joking?

309
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,302
You're a natural at this.

310
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,721
Haven't you ever considered work...

311
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,599
...as a beautician?

312
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,313
OK, that's done.

313
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,940
What are the gloves for?

314
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,444
Let's wait a while.
You're not quite ready for that yet.

315
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,947
No, he's not quite ready.

316
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,908
What do you mean,
not ready for what?

317
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,327
- What is this?
- We'll explain.

318
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,415
We need to talk, Marcelle!
This training's not working.

319
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,333
Ready or not,

320
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,461
I'm not emptying the ass
of a guy I don't know.

321
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,089
Or even of a guy I do know.

322
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:33,050
I don't empty anyone's ass,
on principle.

323
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,512
Can I finish eating first?

324
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,477
No.

325
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,980
Let's just leave it at this.

326
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,608
I don't go for this sick stuff.

327
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,736
The stockings were bad enough.

328
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,779
But I met you part way.

329
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,325
Your turn.
Drop the ass emptying.

330
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,868
- I get the message.
- It's wrong.

331
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,369
Just drop it.

332
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,704
Enjoy your lunch.

333
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:09,962
Beautiful, huh?

334
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,339
I love it.

335
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,387
Don't mind me.

336
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:22,099
You're not at the movies,
I'm eating here.

337
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,603
Hi. Where can I find a beer?

338
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,480
Maybe in your wig.

339
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,816
You took both packs?

340
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,276
No idea. I don't care.

341
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,070
Take your mop-head for a walk.

342
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,738
Let's go.

343
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,282
He's the guy my dad hired.

344
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,784
Oh, right.

345
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,535
The guy has a name.

346
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,606
- What?
- Sorry.

347
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,400
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

348
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,151
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

349
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,529
Just massaging away.

350
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,376
Fucking weird.

351
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,296
Have you finished playing?

352
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,091
You can't feel a thing?

353
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,802
Have you gone mad?!

354
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,470
He's experimenting.

355
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,097
He can't feel a thing.

356
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,640
You'll burn him!

357
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,901
Lawyer.

358
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:57,778
Lawyer.

359
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:03,492
That's personal.
I'll read it later.

360
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,910
The "personal" file?

361
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:12,752
Trash.

362
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,629
She's not bad.

363
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,674
How about a "hooker" file?

364
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,640
Enjoy your meal.

365
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,309
Thank you.

366
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,607
Do you mind?

367
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,112
Sorry.

368
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,875
Shit, I keep forgetting.

369
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,712
Shit, sorry.

370
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,930
That feels good.

371
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,934
<i>Driss, come here, please.</i>

372
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,686
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

373
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,065
<i>Come here, please.</i>

374
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,410
What?

375
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,039
It's nearly nine. Philippe's waiting.

376
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:35,167
Nine already? This bath gel
takes ages to foam.

377
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,335
What a pigsty.

378
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,546
Can you make my coffee?

379
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:39,713
The baby monitor!

380
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,423
Always with you!

381
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,592
And Nutella!

382
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,387
Not that jam made with weird fruit!

383
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,324
I'm not getting in this.

384
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,745
And I'm not loading you
into the back like a horse.

385
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,000
What's this?

386
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,086
That one's less suitable.

387
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,548
Meaning?

388
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,759
Unfortunately,
we need to be pragmatic.

389
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,762
Pragmatic?

390
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:33,893
Holy fuck.

391
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,478
Listen to that.

392
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,355
- It feels so good.
- It's great.

393
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,773
This is good.

394
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,318
She's nervy.

395
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,028
Let's go!

396
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,624
The neighbor keeps parking there.

397
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,751
He thinks it's his space.

398
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,714
Not for much longer.

399
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,302
How's it going?

400
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:11,805
Am I bothering you, Blondie?
Want a coffee?

401
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,143
Come on.

402
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,396
- Go on, read this!
- "Keep free at all times."

403
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,564
Louder!

404
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,524
That's the way.

405
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,485
- Read it all.
- "Reserved parking."

406
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,820
Get that into your thick skull
and move!

407
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,907
Go on, Blondie, piss off!

408
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,836
We open Tuesday.
It'll be sold by then.

409
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,129
Can we go?

410
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,675
You've been there an hour.
Time to switch channels.

411
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:52,638
There's a lot of serenity in it.
A certain violence too.

412
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,014
It's very touching.

413
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,850
Touching? Red splashes on white?

414
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,602
How much is it?

415
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,855
Thirty thousand euros, I think,
but I'll check.

416
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,565
Yeah, check.

417
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,151
That price seems way high to me.

418
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,324
You can't buy this crap!
It's not possible!

419
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:13,867
It is possible.

420
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,745
The guy wants 30 grand
for a nosebleed!

421
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,747
Tell me, Driss,

422
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,874
why are people interested in art?

423
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,670
- It's all business, I guess.
- No.

424
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,382
It's the trace
of our passage on this earth.

425
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,175
Bullshit.

426
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,220
For 50 euros,
I'll do you a trace of my passage.

427
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,847
I'll even add some blue!

428
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,599
Enough. Give me a chocolate.

429
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,060
No.

430
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,646
Give me a chocolate.

431
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,649
No handy, no candy.

432
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,487
It's a joke.

433
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,364
I'm kidding.

434
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,950
- It's a joke?
- Yes.

435
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,244
- A joke.
- It's a good one.

436
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,329
A very good joke.

437
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,915
That's the punch line, see.

438
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,834
But in your case...

439
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,127
Come on.

440
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,921
- It's wicked.
- It's a good joke.

441
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,008
You got no hands, Philippe.

442
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,012
I'll tell it to Marge Simpson.

443
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,518
I was wrong about the price.

444
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,855
It's 41,500 euros.

445
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:26,940
I'll take it.

446
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:28,859
You will?

447
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,245
Hi, Philippe.

448
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:41,955
How are you doing?

449
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,167
You summoned me, so here I am.

450
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,543
I'm listening.

451
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:49,505
What's so urgent?

452
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,965
I didn't summon you.

453
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,098
You must have some idea
why I'm here.

454
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,060
Who is this fellow?

455
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,354
Everyone's worried.

456
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,857
Yvonne tells me
he's reckless, violent...

457
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,275
He hit a neighbor?

458
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,947
I don't need to tell you
you have to be vigilant.

459
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,950
Don't let just anyone
into your home,

460
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,785
especially not in your state.

461
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:25,999
I'm not really sure
you know whom you're dealing with.

462
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,378
Carry on.

463
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,298
I called Sivot
at the Justice Ministry.

464
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,467
The boy isn't Al Capone,

465
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,761
but young Driss has a record.

466
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,014
He just did six months for robbery.

467
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:44,977
On top of the rest...

468
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,896
...I'm told he's useless.

469
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,231
Be careful.

470
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,608
These street guys have no pity.

471
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,027
That's it exactly.

472
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,489
That's what I want. No pity.

473
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:01,827
He often hands me the phone
because he forgets.

474
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,747
True, he isn't compassionate.

475
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,125
But he's strong, with arms and legs.

476
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:11,170
His brain works, he's healthy.

477
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,923
So, all the rest,
given my state, as you call it,

478
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,759
his background and so on,
I don't give a shit.

479
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,762
As you wish.

480
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,392
Will that be all?

481
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,105
Magalie...

482
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,774
- Got a minute?
- Not really.

483
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,068
I want to show you something.

484
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:36,945
What is it?

485
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,281
Chill, you can always say no.

486
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,658
One minute then.

487
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:48,957
So?

488
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,417
So I have a bathtub.

489
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,628
That's all.

490
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,088
Very interesting.

491
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,719
- And...
- We could take a bath.

492
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,471
There's plenty of room.

493
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,973
I have bath salts and foam.

494
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:09,394
Why not?

495
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,231
Yeah. Why not?

496
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,734
Go on then, get undressed.

497
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:16,902
Look at you!

498
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,112
The saucy kind. I like it.

499
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,573
OK, I'll get undressed.

500
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:26,453
What?

501
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,122
Where are you going?

502
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,582
You said yes!

503
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,960
Just a quick rinse!

504
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,298
What's with you?

505
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,426
I'm always tense
when the mail arrives.

506
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,846
As Apollinaire said:

507
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:50,894
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter from you..."

508
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,896
Slower, you're losing me.

509
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:56,149
I'm at "As Apollinaire said:"

510
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,610
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter..."

511
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:05,242
You may not realize,
but this is private.

512
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,661
No, I didn't realize.

513
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:08,912
Give me that.

514
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,872
Only if you explain.

515
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,041
There's nothing to explain.

516
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,168
He writes letters.

517
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,920
Letters?

518
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,046
Who to?

519
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,923
Usually to women.

520
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,174
Come on, who?

521
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,762
One in particular. Eléonore.

522
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,223
Who? We've never seen her.

523
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,850
How come?

524
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,727
It's an epistolary relationship.

525
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:39,651
Meaning they write to each other.
They correspond solely by mail.

526
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,445
No need to spell it out.

527
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,408
The blue envelopes?

528
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,079
He's hot stuff.

529
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,789
He epistoles.

530
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,751
How about you?

531
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,627
No lover in sight?

532
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,089
Albert the gardener, say?

533
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,507
Certainly not!

534
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,219
I've seen the longing looks
he gives you.

535
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,764
Am I wrong? Yes or no?

536
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,350
Stop it, it's ridiculous.

537
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,810
Has he slipped it to you?

538
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,729
- What?
- His little cucumber.

539
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,733
What?

540
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:22,819
I must be dreaming.

541
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,196
Albert, Albert.

542
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,531
He will soon.

543
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,657
He will soon.

544
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,012
Shit!

545
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:56,853
Are you OK?

546
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,693
Want some music?

547
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:28,844
It's all right.

548
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,346
Calm down.

549
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:50,991
Take it easy.

550
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,534
Try to breathe slowly.

551
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,330
You're with me.

552
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,377
Take it easy.

553
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,342
Try to breathe slowly.

554
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:15,223
It's all right.

555
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,416
I need air!

556
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,335
I need air!

557
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,369
Shit!

558
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,584
It's good to breathe.

559
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,088
What time is it?

560
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,173
I don't know. Around 4:00 a.m.

561
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,886
It's ages
since I saw Paris by night.

562
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,764
What happened?

563
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,558
The medication has its limits.

564
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,436
Doctors call them phantom pains.

565
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,776
I feel like a frozen steak
tossed onto a red-hot griddle.

566
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:54,197
I feel nothing but suffer anyway.

567
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,494
Surely something could help.

568
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,666
That could.

569
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:12,215
We're all sick for that,
me worse than you probably.

570
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:18,513
I wanted to ask you...
With women...

571
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,724
How do you manage?

572
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,852
You adapt.

573
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,354
So can you do it or not?

574
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,189
You may not realize,

575
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,901
but I feel nothing
from my neck to my toes.

576
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,195
So you can't.

577
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,366
It's not that simple.

578
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,369
I can, but it's not my decision.

579
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,705
And you can find pleasure elsewhere.

580
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:44,873
Yeah?

581
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,291
You've no idea.

582
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:49,544
You're right. How, for example?

583
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,796
For example, the ears.

584
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:54,883
The ears?

585
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:59,387
The ears are a highly sensitive
erogenous zone.

586
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,514
You get your ears licked?

587
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,602
I'd never have guessed.

588
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,440
Philippe?

589
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:27,957
- Try this. It'll help.
- What is this crap?

590
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,043
It can't hurt you.

591
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,504
Drag on it.

592
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:33,880
Go on, drag on it.

593
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,342
Take it easy. Share it.

594
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,595
Again.

595
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:45,392
One more time.

596
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,935
That's enough for now.

597
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,815
Sorry, but you really get off
with your ears?

598
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:55,944
If your ears are red,
that means you're turned on?

599
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,570
Exactly.

600
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,573
Sometimes they're hard when I wake.

601
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,452
- Both of them?
- Yes!

602
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:11,251
I met my wife Alice
when we were students.

603
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:14,379
She was tall, very elegant,

604
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,839
with laughing eyes.

605
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,259
Is she the blond in the photos?

606
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:20,885
She's not bad.

607
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,388
What we had was incredible.

608
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,974
I hope you experience that one day.

609
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:29,894
Fuck, I loved her so much!
I loved her so much.

610
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,449
Then she got pregnant.

611
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,368
Five successive miscarriages.

612
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:52,625
Then the verdict came in.
An incurable, terminal illness.

613
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,628
We decided to adopt.

614
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:10,769
Waiter!

615
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,645
Excuse me!

616
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,774
Excuse me!

617
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,197
Yes?

618
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,367
A tarte tatin, please.

619
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,331
Cooked.
The chocolate cake was raw.

620
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:35,543
It was all squashy and gooey.
Weird.

621
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,755
That's what molten cake is.

622
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:40,673
- So that's why.
- Yes.

623
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,759
I'll have a tarte tatin anyway.

624
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:45,261
I've always loved competition,

625
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,555
extreme sports, speed.

626
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,766
Going faster, higher.

627
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,228
A paraglider gave me that.

628
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:56,815
I was high in the sky,
looking down at things, breathing.

629
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,818
I was raised to think
we pissed on the world.

630
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,947
Some water. My mouth's dry.

631
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,910
The joint does that.

632
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,205
And what else?

633
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:13,373
Makes you hungry

634
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,667
and chatty.

635
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:23,716
But bad weather can be fatal
when paragliding.

636
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,594
And you flew anyway?

637
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,723
Yes, maybe to suffer like Alice.
I knew she'd never recover.

638
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:36,729
I broke the third and fourth vertebrae.
Now only fly in my mind.

639
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,567
When the pain eases,
I have my thoughts.

640
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,738
My real handicap
isn't being in a chair.

641
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:50,660
It's living without her.

642
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,040
What do the doctors say?

643
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,794
With the advances in medicine,
they'll keep me going to 70

644
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:02,630
with massages and pick-me-ups.

645
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,758
It's expensive,
but I'm a rich invalid.

646
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,763
I'd have shot myself.

647
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,683
That's not easy in my condition.

648
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,768
True.

649
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,146
That sucks.

650
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,025
What's the date today?

651
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,610
The eighth or the ninth.

652
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,194
It's official then.

653
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,738
What is?

654
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,281
You've won your bet.

655
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,783
Your trial period's over.

656
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:31,868
I'm hired then?

657
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:33,786
Yes, you're hired.

658
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,955
Can I count on you now?

659
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,999
- Yes.
- Good.

660
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,793
Start by giving my Fabergé egg back.

661
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:45,256
Alice gave me one each year.

662
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,217
I have 25, one for each year
we were together.

663
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,303
I cherish it.

664
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,807
I don't know why you...
Wasn't me.

665
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,810
What did you lose again?

666
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,283
Mina!

667
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:13,493
Mina!

668
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,831
- What's up?
- Get in.

669
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,918
Buckle up.

670
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:34,722
How's it going?

671
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,313
How's school?

672
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,526
Why don't you text me back?

673
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:49,779
I was busy.

674
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,284
Let's hear it.
Who called?

675
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,621
A cop, to talk to Mom.
I put on a deep voice

676
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,331
and said we'd go.

677
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,168
Found my egg?

678
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,424
Have you found it?

679
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,635
Screw your stone egg.
I haven't found it.

680
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,479
What did you say?

681
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,398
What could I say?

682
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:27,900
I only had 30 grams on me.

683
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:31,320
For that you get a spell in custody,
then it's bye-bye.

684
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,031
Let's get a kebab.

685
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,616
I'm not getting in that!

686
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:36,784
Let go of me.

687
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:37,869
Where are you going?

688
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:40,538
Who's driving you?

689
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:41,789
Get lost!

690
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,499
It's not your business.

691
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,126
Piss off!

692
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,890
Fuck!

693
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,977
"Her shining eyes
are made of charming minerals

694
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:05,938
and in this strange,
symbolic world..."

695
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,484
"And in this strange...

696
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,569
...symbolic...

697
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:13,738
...world..."

698
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,615
Fucking boring!

699
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,745
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

700
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,456
Is that with an "i" or a "y"?

701
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,958
This is killing my mind.

702
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,170
"Sphinx" is with an "i."

703
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,339
Why bother with this crap?

704
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,258
Sphinxes, daisies, angels...

705
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,719
You'd go for this stuff?

706
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,847
True, one could be more direct.

707
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,310
"And ancient sphinx..." Go on.

708
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,145
What's she look like?

709
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,940
I don't know.
That's not what matters.

710
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:53,444
It's intellectual and emotional,
not physical.

711
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,446
I want a mind-to-mind relationship.

712
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:59,408
If she's a troll,
it'll be mind-to-troll!

713
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,745
Very subtle. Really.

714
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:05,540
What can I say?

715
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,250
Bravo.

716
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,335
How long's it been going on?

717
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,926
Please.

718
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:19,679
Six months.

719
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:21,305
Six months?

720
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,724
And you've never seen her?

721
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,311
Maybe she's fat and ugly.
Or handicapped.

722
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,815
At the end of the poem
put "How's your weight?"

723
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:35,570
Thank you very much
for your sound advice, Driss.

724
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,447
Let's carry on. Where was I?

725
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:42,743
A sphinx was eating daisies
with an angel,

726
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,829
then running and doing stuff.

727
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:46,956
Let me see...

728
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:49,917
"In this strange,
symbolic world..."

729
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:54,088
"In this strange,
symbolic world..."

730
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,256
Call her!

731
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:59,886
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

732
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,345
Call her, OK!

733
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:05,725
I can get more across
with the written word, OK?

734
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:07,685
He's incredible.

735
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:11,564
I'm going to find her number.
This is stressing me out.

736
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:16,694
Dunkirk. That's bad.

737
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,279
Put that down.

738
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:20,072
No beauty queens there.

739
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,158
Only trolls.

740
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:23,951
Put that down right now.

741
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,536
Her number's here.

742
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,914
That means she wants you to call!

743
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,957
Put it down, please!

744
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,001
She wrote her number here.

745
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:35,004
That means:
"Call me, I'll lick your ear."

746
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:37,840
What's he doing?
Don't call her.

747
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,384
Enough poetry after six months.

748
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,511
He's totally crazy!

749
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,430
I won't speak to her.

750
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:47,433
I bet she has an accent.
They talk weird up there.

751
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,976
Hang up!

752
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,686
"I want my Philippe."

753
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,230
She's gonna get him.

754
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,107
The voice sounds OK.

755
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,157
Improvise, talk about the daisies...

756
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,785
Eléonore? It's Philippe.

757
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:11,499
I'm calling because I really wanted
to hear the sound of your voice

758
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:15,002
and with that first "hello,"

759
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,630
- I'm fulfilled.
<i>- I'll put her on.</i>

760
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,134
Too wordy.
Try simpler sentences.

761
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,012
Eléonore, it's Philippe.

762
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:27,098
<i>Philippe?</i>

763
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:29,350
I was writing you a letter and...

764
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:34,063
...it just hit me,
"Why don't I call her?"

765
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,065
Ask her weight!

766
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:39,485
<i>- I'm sorry?</i>
- No, nothing.

767
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,028
"I'm in mourning,

768
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,155
I weep, I'm afraid.

769
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:44,991
Lord, fresh air..."

770
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,535
Yes, "The Foolish Virgin."
You're unbeatable.

771
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,036
I love Rimbaud too.

772
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,122
Sorry, I was here first.

773
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,666
Eléonore, I'm so happy.

774
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,627
What a chatterbox!

775
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,921
There's no stopping you now.

776
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:00,423
Take care.

777
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,718
Let's all take care,
let's all lick our ears.

778
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:04,969
Excellent.

779
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:06,637
Well?

780
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,182
Good news and not so good news.

781
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:11,767
The good news?

782
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,060
Fifty-three kilos.

783
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,062
Fifty-three kilos, that's good.

784
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,564
Unless she's one meter tall.

785
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:21,444
The bad news is, she wants a photo.

786
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,113
- So?
- Very funny.

787
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,532
Your tickets, please.

788
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:27,616
Good evening.

789
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:28,784
Right here.

790
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,578
- OK.
- Have a good evening.

791
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:33,247
If you want us,
we won't move from there.

792
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:34,957
Especially him.

793
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,338
What do you think women want?

794
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:41,756
I don't know.

795
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,508
Beauty, charm, elegance...

796
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:48,387
Bullshit!
They want dough and security.

797
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,390
Just ask him.

798
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,977
And you have what it takes.

799
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:57,188
I'm naïve.

800
00:55:57,355 --> 00:56:00,983
I hope to charm with more
than just my bank account.

801
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:06,280
After six months reading
your lame poems, she's hot for you.

802
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:10,117
She's an original all right.
The chair won't bother her.

803
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,411
That's true.

804
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:15,623
Up north,
guys drink and beat women.

805
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,416
She'll be safe with you.

806
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,001
Bastard.

807
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:22,129
Pragmatic, right?

808
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,299
I don't know.

809
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:29,261
If she sends her photo,
it means she wants to go further.

810
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,516
Send a photo of you
without the chair really showing.

811
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:36,185
It doesn't have to be
a telethon one

812
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:38,396
with you drooling

813
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,065
and looking like shit.

814
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:43,067
OK, I get the message.

815
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,958
This guy's not well.
He's not at all well.

816
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,085
What?

817
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,215
He's a tree?

818
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,300
A singing tree.

819
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:16,976
That's German!

820
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,311
What?

821
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,689
It's in German.

822
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:23,065
In German.

823
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,776
You're a nutcase.

824
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,903
What a drag.

825
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,697
- How long does it last?
- Four hours.

826
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:30,948
Fuck!

827
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,996
Good-looking back then.

828
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:39,874
Which one?

829
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:43,794
This one.

830
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:50,092
Or maybe this one.

831
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:55,264
Sure, there's a problem,
but you look good.

832
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,600
Wanna try it?

833
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:58,809
I don't know.

834
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,229
- Wasn't it a blast talking to her?
- Yes, it was.

835
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,397
That's all?

836
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,691
- A fucking blast.
- So?

837
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:09,153
Put the damn photo in an envelope!

838
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,615
There.
The very words I wanted to hear.

839
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,370
Gimme a cig.

840
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,539
Don't you ever knock?

841
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:22,333
You're painting?

842
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,960
- Get out.
- Seriously? You're painting?

843
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,670
Learned to read too?

844
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,131
What do you want?
Get lost!

845
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:31,091
Going to hit a woman?

846
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,635
You do that in your country?

847
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,553
You're whacked! Get out.

848
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,347
- Get out now!
- I'll go when I want.

849
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:37,973
Get the hell out!

850
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,184
- I've decided to go now.
- Get out!

851
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:41,894
Shit.

852
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,396
Replace that photo with the other.

853
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:49,944
Make sure to post it yourself.
And be discreet.

854
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,987
As you wish.

855
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,282
Put the other photo in the trash.

856
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:56,825
I'm blowing a fuse!

857
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,328
HOOKERS

858
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,542
- What's wrong?
- Your daughter!

859
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:06,377
I was painting.

860
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,754
You were painting?

861
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,422
I'm telling you,

862
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,217
set her straight
or I'll demolish her!

863
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:15,844
- Calm down.
- No, I won't calm down!

864
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,055
I'm your arms and legs here?

865
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,308
- That's right.
- I want to be your hands

866
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:25,104
to give her a slap
'cause all you can do is run her down!

867
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:28,440
Aren't you overdoing it?
Yvonne?

868
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:37,074
She could do
with being set straight a bit.

869
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:38,284
A bit?

870
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,369
At 16, she dresses like a tramp!

871
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:43,163
She keeps making out
with mop-head.

872
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,124
But that's not my problem.

873
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:49,336
What bothers me
are her high and mighty airs,

874
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,422
the way she talks to you and me.

875
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:54,466
No respect.
She treats us like dogs.

876
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:58,137
Say the word and I'll set her straight.

877
00:59:58,304 --> 00:59:59,471
I get the message.

878
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,473
Let me talk to her.

879
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,478
So talk to her, and fast.

880
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,690
Do something.
Set her straight.

881
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,484
He paints? What does he paint?

882
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,403
No idea.

883
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,592
Wake up.

884
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:38,510
Rise and shine.

885
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,517
Here we go.
Power-hose time.

886
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,022
Respect the people
I need around me.

887
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,649
It's intolerable.

888
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:35,150
<i>Is that clear?</i>

889
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,027
Be tougher on her!

890
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,571
I don't want that mop-head around.

891
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:42,157
- Give me a break.
- I'm not through!

892
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:45,160
I have to run you down
to get you to obey?

893
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,579
There, he's done it!

894
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,210
You painted this?

895
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:54,378
Yeah.

896
01:01:55,504 --> 01:01:56,505
I love it.

897
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,759
I'm not saying
I'd necessarily hang it

898
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,302
in my place, but...

899
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,347
What can we get for it?

900
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:08,892
We'll see.

901
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,478
See more or see less?

902
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:13,856
It's...

903
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:16,400
Are you nuts?

904
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,402
C'mon! No tongues, OK.

905
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:19,695
You're sick in the head!

906
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:22,781
I don't believe this.

907
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,491
Speed it up a bit.

908
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:25,868
I'm flat-out.

909
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:29,496
You're way too slow!

910
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,874
Twelve kilometers an hour is cool?

911
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,125
That's cool.

912
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,418
Twelve kilometers an hour is cool,
right?

913
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:36,879
No faster?

914
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,630
- That's the top speed.
- OK.

915
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,291
Stick to the ears.

916
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:36,605
Yes, Yvonne.

917
01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:39,066
No, he can't hear.
He's nowhere near me.

918
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,527
He can't hear me, Yvonne.

919
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:45,948
We'll be there at 8:30 sharp.

920
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,157
We'll push it back.

921
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,992
Goodbye, Yvonne.

922
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,078
She's stressed out?

923
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:54,748
Yes, your birthday surprise
will be half an hour later.

924
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:58,460
She gets into a terrible state
every year.

925
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:01,922
She invites my whole family.
It all goes like clockwork.

926
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,510
They come to see
if I'm still alive.

927
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,470
The annual check-up.

928
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,100
I pretend to be surprised.

929
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,394
We all make an effort,

930
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:17,729
but, to be honest,
we all get bored shitless.

931
01:04:57,436 --> 01:04:58,437
Excuse me...

932
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:00,480
Excuse me...

933
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,613
Do you mind moving along?

934
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,240
Yes, I do mind.

935
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:11,366
All right.

936
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,577
Thank you. Move along.

937
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,788
Move just one seat along.

938
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,499
Very kind.

939
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:32,804
A suit changes a man.

940
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,474
You look good.

941
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,061
You look like Obama.

942
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:41,855
Yeah?

943
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,693
She's hot for me, I can tell.

944
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,236
Barack Obama.

945
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:49,529
Classy.

946
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:55,661
That's like comparing you...

947
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:57,829
...to George Bush...

948
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,123
...or Nixon.

949
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,260
What's up? You'll miss the concert.

950
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,637
Leave me alone!

951
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,056
Got your period?

952
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,599
Piss off!

953
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:18,809
What's wrong?

954
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:20,936
Elisa...

955
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,898
- Leave me be!
- What did you take?

956
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:27,859
What did you do?

957
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:31,947
Where's this from?

958
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:33,740
Yvonne's purse.

959
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:34,908
Imodium?

960
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:37,369
What was this for?

961
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:38,954
To kill yourself?

962
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:41,373
You won't shit for months now!

963
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:42,874
Leave me alone.

964
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,251
Hold on...

965
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,671
You took Tylenol too?
You're dying.

966
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:48,922
This is bad!

967
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,843
Shall I call an ambulance?

968
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:54,553
Why did you do it?

969
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,055
Because of Bastien.

970
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:58,765
What about him?

971
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:01,268
He dumped me,
he doesn't give a shit.

972
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:03,311
He even called me a slut.

973
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,855
That's bad.

974
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:07,441
It'd suit everyone if I died.

975
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,776
Stop talking crap. Come downstairs.

976
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,654
Go to see him for me.
Talk to him.

977
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:13,739
Who?

978
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,824
Bastien. I'll pay you.

979
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,243
Pay me? Are you out of your mind?

980
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,537
Spare me this childish shit.

981
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:21,788
Please!

982
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,458
I talk to Bastien
and you pay me.

983
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,918
Who do you think I am?

984
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,464
Driss, please!

985
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,758
How much?

986
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:35,927
Jerk.

987
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:41,933
It has style.
There's a certain touch.

988
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:45,312
But 11,000 for an unknown artist...

989
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:54,321
But if I say no
and the value triples, I'll regret it

990
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:56,406
and you'll say, "I told you so."

991
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,578
He has a show in London?

992
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,038
And Berlin soon.

993
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:05,040
Berlin too.

994
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,961
I don't know.

995
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,548
Eleven thousand euros
is quite a sum.

996
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,676
<i>Come on, fill me in here.</i>

997
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:18,261
Is she with someone?

998
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:21,264
All right. Yes. Fred.

999
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,432
Fred?

1000
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:25,018
They've been together two years...

1001
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,979
...but with ups and downs.

1002
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:29,981
Things are often tense.

1003
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,984
They're pretty rocky now.

1004
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,487
Maybe because of me?

1005
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,989
- Has she mentioned me?
- No.

1006
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,451
Of course. A little.

1007
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,912
Fuck! She's hot for me.

1008
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,375
You're bullshitting me?

1009
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,627
- No.
- Bullshit away!

1010
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,671
I'll bed Magalie one day.

1011
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,589
Hope keeps us going.

1012
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,385
Easy on those
if you have stomach trouble.

1013
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:00,720
I'm no doctor,

1014
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,306
but Imodium means there's a problem.

1015
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:14,901
Excuse me.

1016
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,863
Can I ask a favor of you?

1017
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,323
One more piece just for me?

1018
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,868
No, we were cool.

1019
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,454
Vivaldi's <i>Four Seasons:</i>

1020
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,373
"L'Estate."

1021
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,666
You'll like this.

1022
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,209
Shit.

1023
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:50,020
Come on,
don't tell me you feel nothing.

1024
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:53,857
Not a thing.
It doesn't do a thing for me.

1025
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:56,109
Music's something you dance to.

1026
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,570
Let's try something else.

1027
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:06,453
I know that one.

1028
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,079
That's an ad.

1029
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,123
For coffee.

1030
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:17,964
Oyez, by mandate,

1031
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,800
I'm expected at the chateau...

1032
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:24,137
...to bring the minstrels there.

1033
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:26,890
I'm a good knight.

1034
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,477
That one's fishy.

1035
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,188
I see people without clothes.

1036
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:37,984
They're running.
I see them running naked.

1037
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,277
And giggling.

1038
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:42,072
All right.

1039
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,281
Bach was hot.

1040
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:47,702
Women went for him.
The Barry White of his day.

1041
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:51,790
I know this one!

1042
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:54,042
I know it. Everyone knows it.

1043
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,543
Sure!

1044
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:58,672
"This is the Paris Benefit Office.

1045
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,132
All our lines are currently busy.

1046
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:03,301
Waiting time: Two years."

1047
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,103
"Tom and Jerry," right?

1048
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:21,820
"Tom and Jerry."

1049
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,823
What a jerk.

1050
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,158
Someone help me.
A masterpiece.

1051
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,620
OK, after your classics,

1052
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,163
let's listen to mine.

1053
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:34,124
Earth, Wind & Fire.

1054
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,292
It's a killer.

1055
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:40,255
Something else, huh?

1056
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:42,757
Definitely something else.

1057
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:46,177
Call my name, I won't answer.

1058
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,764
- Driss!
- I'm not answering.

1059
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,182
Here we go.

1060
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,759
It's a birthday party!

1061
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,427
Let's dance!
Come on, move!

1062
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:29,304
It's his birthday!

1063
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:31,806
Yeah, Yvonne.

1064
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:33,058
Ace, Albert.

1065
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,237
Spin! Spin!

1066
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,817
All right.

1067
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,277
Time for my little gift.

1068
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:29,572
I didn't want to spoil things

1069
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,325
if she turned out to be ugly.
You never know.

1070
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,285
She answered anyhow.

1071
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,162
Good night.

1072
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:40,834
I'll open it. You'll take ages.

1073
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,004
Well?

1074
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,967
- She's not a troll.
- Really?

1075
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,386
Shit.

1076
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,055
The only one in Dunkirk
with all her teeth!

1077
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,182
There's a note too.

1078
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,935
"I'll be in Paris next week.

1079
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,396
I'll be expecting your call."
And three dots!

1080
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,691
Meaning what?

1081
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:07,610
- Any idea?
- It's a good sign?

1082
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,654
You bet. She wants nooky.

1083
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:12,532
Three dots. One, two and three dots.

1084
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:13,950
"She wants nooky."

1085
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,077
I'm getting nooky.

1086
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,746
It's looking good.

1087
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,206
How can I sleep now?

1088
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,292
You'll manage.

1089
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:24,043
I'll put her here.

1090
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:26,421
She'll watch you sleep.

1091
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,674
Good night, Philippe.

1092
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,051
Sweet dreams.

1093
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:45,815
Try the cap again.

1094
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:49,777
Not bad.

1095
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,780
No way!
He looks like a farmer.

1096
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:55,366
- Go for traditional.
- That's what I said.

1097
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:58,119
- How's this?
- No good. Too traditional.

1098
01:14:58,286 --> 01:15:01,372
Forget the caps and hats,
find something.

1099
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:04,334
Traditional or trendy?

1100
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,252
That's it.

1101
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,670
This works.

1102
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,547
The angler look?

1103
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:11,633
We're off to Dunkirk.

1104
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,637
I'll go with Yvonne. We'll be fine.

1105
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:16,804
You sure?

1106
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:21,392
Yes, I'll manage.

1107
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:22,644
Fine.

1108
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,483
I'm a bit stressed out.

1109
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,402
It doesn't show. You look great.

1110
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,241
4ac minus b².

1111
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,617
- Minus b²?
- Yeah.

1112
01:15:37,784 --> 01:15:39,285
I got 20 instead.

1113
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:40,537
Come here, you.

1114
01:15:41,663 --> 01:15:43,498
Take a hike, Justin Bieber.

1115
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:45,667
Recognize me, Bastien?

1116
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,335
Yeah. What's up?

1117
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:49,504
You said a bad thing to Elisa.

1118
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:51,172
- I said nothing.
- Shut up!

1119
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,841
Act like a man and apologize.

1120
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,134
OK, I'm sorry.

1121
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,302
Hands off.

1122
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,471
- Not to me, to her.
- Right.

1123
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:01,015
Bring her croissants each day.

1124
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,850
- Plain or chocolate?
- What?

1125
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,269
Plain or chocolate?

1126
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:05,562
Whatever.

1127
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,313
Just do it right.

1128
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,023
You're nice to her.

1129
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,316
Now piss off.

1130
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:11,859
Go on, get lost.

1131
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,861
And try using a barrette!

1132
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,158
What time is it?

1133
01:16:20,994 --> 01:16:22,370
It's 4:45.

1134
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,421
Let's take the cap off.

1135
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,215
Good idea.

1136
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,392
Now what time is it?

1137
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:48,187
Forty-six or 47.
Time doesn't move very fast.

1138
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,690
I'd like a whisky.

1139
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:32,398
Another.

1140
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,108
Is that a good idea?

1141
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:35,610
A double!

1142
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:40,865
Waiter, a double whisky, please.

1143
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,231
<i>Driss?</i>

1144
01:18:13,398 --> 01:18:15,274
Am I disturbing you?

1145
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,443
<i>I'm at the gym. Well?</i>

1146
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:20,071
Do you feel like getting away?

1147
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,323
<i>No questions asked?</i>

1148
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:23,574
No questions, no.

1149
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,411
- You want to split?
<i>- Exactly.</i>

1150
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:28,413
And go where?

1151
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,249
To breathe a little.

1152
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,376
Breathe a little?

1153
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:36,754
I'll shower and be right there.

1154
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,300
We're leaving. The cap...

1155
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:42,927
It's only just six...

1156
01:18:43,094 --> 01:18:44,137
We're leaving!

1157
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,009
Good evening.

1158
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:32,977
Give him some champagne
to help him relax.

1159
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:34,645
I'm not tense.

1160
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,022
- You're not?
- No.

1161
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,416
It's just us?

1162
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,294
No other people on board?

1163
01:19:58,461 --> 01:19:59,670
Just us?

1164
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,484
I don't like this.

1165
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:22,652
Why not?

1166
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:24,779
I don't know.

1167
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,574
Because you seem kind of jinxed.

1168
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,536
The accident, the wheelchair,

1169
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:32,703
your wife...

1170
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,289
Sounds like the Kennedys.

1171
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:38,584
Miss?

1172
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,921
Could we have the package please?

1173
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:43,089
Thank you.

1174
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:48,928
Thank you.

1175
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,222
Why?

1176
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:00,857
What the hell?

1177
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:04,902
Your value on the art market.
I managed to get 11,000 euros.

1178
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,614
Keep at it. You have talent.

1179
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,367
That's a great deal.
I sensed something.

1180
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,161
It all came about instinctively.

1181
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:18,207
With the music playing,
it made for a really good blend.

1182
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:22,211
It was a sort of revelation,
like I saw the light.

1183
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,546
Don't get carried away.

1184
01:21:23,713 --> 01:21:26,382
Eleven thousand
for my first painting!

1185
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,426
What was that?

1186
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,512
Just a hole in the fuselage.

1187
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:32,930
We won't make it.

1188
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,099
Tell me what's up!

1189
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:39,020
- Glad to have known you.
- Not funny.

1190
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:43,399
I know you're used to tragedy,
but I'm not.

1191
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,642
You gotta be nuts to do that.

1192
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:18,851
A little.

1193
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:26,525
I have to say something.

1194
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:29,362
You're a total headcase.

1195
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:30,905
Really?

1196
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,117
Now get Driss ready.

1197
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:39,705
Sure. No way I'm doing that.

1198
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:42,458
I'll be over there taking photos.

1199
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,001
"Get Driss ready!"

1200
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:46,337
How will you take photos?

1201
01:22:46,796 --> 01:22:48,839
Laugh. I'm not doing it.

1202
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:01,310
Holy shit.

1203
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:03,771
I'm not going.

1204
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,773
- Hold on.
- How do I get this off?

1205
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,693
I don't have to do it.

1206
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,577
I'm not doing this!

1207
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:20,913
I lost my fucking shoe!

1208
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,581
My shoe's down there.

1209
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:27,461
Motherfucker!
We're heading up!

1210
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:39,974
What the fuck!

1211
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:42,393
- What's going on?
- Hey, Driss.

1212
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,439
Relax, pal.

1213
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:49,859
I'm relaxed,
but I want to be down there.

1214
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,407
Fucking hell!

1215
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:03,706
I'm having a blast!

1216
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,326
Where do you find an invalid?

1217
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,412
- I don't know.
- Where you leave him.

1218
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,207
That's a good one.

1219
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:48,918
Bastard.

1220
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,422
Someone for you, Driss.

1221
01:24:56,467 --> 01:24:58,302
What are you doing here?

1222
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:01,097
I should ask you that.
You kept this quiet.

1223
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:02,515
How did you know?

1224
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,226
Benefit sent this, with the address.

1225
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,311
What's that?

1226
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:08,854
Forget it.

1227
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,981
- What happened?
- I fell off a scooter.

1228
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,650
You fell off a scooter?

1229
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:15,069
Get up.

1230
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:16,987
You fell... Come here.

1231
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:22,451
Shit!

1232
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:27,498
You sleep here?

1233
01:25:28,374 --> 01:25:30,876
- So what happened?
- Nothing.

1234
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,294
Come on, tell me.

1235
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,046
Not your problem.

1236
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:36,507
You're here, it's my problem!

1237
01:25:36,674 --> 01:25:39,385
We got screwed.
The shit's gonna hit the fan.

1238
01:25:39,552 --> 01:25:40,719
No fucking way!

1239
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,012
Does the old lady know?

1240
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,722
No, I'm handling it.

1241
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:46,225
You're handling fuck all!
Quit busting my balls!

1242
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:48,769
Don't touch anything. Wait here!

1243
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:50,479
Can I lie down?

1244
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:52,481
Don't touch a thing!

1245
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,233
OK, I get it!

1246
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:55,985
Watch it, OK!

1247
01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:01,824
No, he's with me.

1248
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:04,034
Quit crying, Mina.

1249
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,328
It's just a scratch.

1250
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:08,080
No, he's fine.

1251
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,416
Calm down, no one's killing no one.

1252
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:13,043
That's all just empty threats.

1253
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:16,589
I can't take care of him.
I gotta work.

1254
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:19,675
No, you don't tell her about it.

1255
01:26:19,884 --> 01:26:22,678
Stay in your room
if you want to cry.

1256
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:32,605
Time for bed?

1257
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,149
I'll stay up a while longer.

1258
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:37,443
Sit down.

1259
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:40,738
Sit down here.

1260
01:26:49,163 --> 01:26:50,873
What do you think of her?

1261
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,961
- She looks hot.
- OK. And what else?

1262
01:26:57,338 --> 01:26:59,882
Let's go up.
I need to do something.

1263
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:02,092
I imagine her standing up,

1264
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:06,096
turning around
and I discover her face at last.

1265
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:12,937
The boy looks like you.
Adama, is that right?

1266
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:14,104
That's right.

1267
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,440
I spotted him earlier.

1268
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:18,692
If I passed him on the street,

1269
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:20,945
I'd know he was your brother.

1270
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:22,988
That's funny.

1271
01:27:24,073 --> 01:27:25,074
Why?

1272
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:26,825
He's not my brother.

1273
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:29,536
He isn't?

1274
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:31,747
It's complicated.

1275
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:35,417
Is he your brother or not?

1276
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:43,050
OK, I get the message.

1277
01:27:44,093 --> 01:27:45,302
Come on, let's go.

1278
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:54,270
My parents...

1279
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,481
...aren't my parents.

1280
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:00,109
They're my uncle and aunt.

1281
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,570
They fetched me from Senegal
when I was eight.

1282
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:08,158
They couldn't have kids
but a brother had loads.

1283
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:10,160
They picked the oldest.

1284
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,288
Me.

1285
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:17,167
My name's Bakary.

1286
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,670
That's my real name.

1287
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:23,048
But other kids had that name
so they called me Idriss

1288
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,092
and that became Driss.

1289
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,053
And afterwards?

1290
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,473
Out of the blue,
my mother... my aunt

1291
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,059
got pregnant once
and then twice.

1292
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,061
Then my uncle died.

1293
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,938
Other men, other kids.

1294
01:28:38,272 --> 01:28:40,190
Like I said, complicated.

1295
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:45,195
Young Adama...
doesn't he need setting straight?

1296
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,248
He came to get you, right?

1297
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,253
Driss...

1298
01:29:04,757 --> 01:29:06,592
I think we'll call it quits.

1299
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,721
You can't be pushing an invalid
for the rest of your life.

1300
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:15,225
After all your hard work,
you've earned your benefit.

1301
01:29:20,773 --> 01:29:23,233
Come on, let's go.

1302
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:26,403
Right.

1303
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:31,658
Bassari Bakary,

1304
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:33,118
Bakary Bassari.

1305
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:36,121
It's beautiful.
It sounds like poetry.

1306
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:40,167
Almost like alliteration.
You know what alliteration is?

1307
01:29:40,334 --> 01:29:41,335
No.

1308
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:47,716
Hello, Bastien.
See you tomorrow.

1309
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:50,677
We'll need a few more for brunch.

1310
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,430
OK. Goodbye, Yvonne.

1311
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,516
- You got my sugar puffs?
- Yes.

1312
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:57,101
Thank you.

1313
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:59,269
- Say hi to Elisa.
- See you tomorrow.

1314
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,313
Hey, Bastien, pal, what's up?

1315
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,481
Come here!

1316
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,240
You're leaving then?

1317
01:30:12,366 --> 01:30:15,786
It's OK, I have your number.
We'll stay in touch.

1318
01:30:16,537 --> 01:30:18,789
It won't be easy, but be strong.

1319
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:22,835
Too bad, I'm getting your room.
Water damage in mine.

1320
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,712
Maybe I'll stay then.

1321
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:27,756
We'll have to squeeze up.

1322
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:32,177
It'll be a bit cramped.
I don't live alone.

1323
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,096
Here.

1324
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:36,390
Meet Frédérique.

1325
01:30:39,852 --> 01:30:40,853
Hey.

1326
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:46,316
All right.

1327
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:47,609
What?

1328
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:48,944
I get it.

1329
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,447
So that's it. You're...

1330
01:30:51,989 --> 01:30:53,073
Yes.

1331
01:30:56,452 --> 01:30:58,829
I won't kiss you goodbye then.

1332
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,003
I'm not against a threesome.

1333
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,218
I'm up for it.
Not now, since I have to go.

1334
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:15,762
But I can come back tonight.

1335
01:31:16,597 --> 01:31:17,848
I have to go now.

1336
01:31:18,015 --> 01:31:19,391
I'm kidding.

1337
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:26,064
Bye, guys.

1338
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,195
Mr. Michel Sabourdi.

1339
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:39,328
Keep it on, channel two.

1340
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,498
You're not angry about Magalie?

1341
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:45,375
No, you had me fooled.

1342
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,545
I couldn't figure out
why she kept resisting.

1343
01:31:53,634 --> 01:31:54,801
A goodbye kiss?

1344
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,263
All right.

1345
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:02,392
Yvonne.

1346
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:06,396
Always bullshitting me.

1347
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:08,482
See you.

1348
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:13,403
Just a second.

1349
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:21,411
We won't be needing this.

1350
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:25,165
OK, bye.

1351
01:32:29,253 --> 01:32:30,671
Get your foot off there.

1352
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:31,838
Come on.

1353
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:52,401
Which bank?

1354
01:32:54,403 --> 01:32:59,324
Could you move your car, please?
You're not allowed to park here.

1355
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:00,492
There's a sign.

1356
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:01,910
I'll move it.

1357
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,245
I'll call you back.

1358
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:08,333
Stop busting his balls.

1359
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,793
We're not driving.

1360
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,378
Matter of principle.

1361
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:17,259
Wait over there for me.

1362
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:30,981
What's going on?

1363
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:32,899
I'm coming.

1364
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,291
I can cancel my date if you want.

1365
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,460
No, certainly not. Why?

1366
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:18,255
Go out and have fun.

1367
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:21,508
OK, Yvonne. I'm ready.

1368
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:23,218
Yes, just a second.

1369
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:27,472
It's all ready.
You just have to serve it.

1370
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:30,183
If there's a problem, call me.

1371
01:35:34,855 --> 01:35:36,606
You'll call me?

1372
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:41,653
If you agree,
I'll serve you your dinner.

1373
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:46,158
Take the coat off.
It's like being in a madhouse.

1374
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:48,702
All right.

1375
01:35:48,869 --> 01:35:50,537
Got a cigarette?

1376
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:52,456
No, I don't smoke.

1377
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:53,623
Well, I used to.

1378
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:57,669
I gave up a short while ago
and, to be honest,

1379
01:35:57,836 --> 01:35:59,546
it would be bad for you,

1380
01:35:59,713 --> 01:36:04,551
even if you don't practice a sport,
for your lungs, your breathing...

1381
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:06,636
...and so on.

1382
01:36:08,764 --> 01:36:10,098
You're not eating?

1383
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,290
Watch what you're doing!

1384
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:18,708
I'm so sorry.

1385
01:37:19,668 --> 01:37:20,710
What is it?

1386
01:37:21,795 --> 01:37:25,507
You wanted a cranial massage.
Here's Mr. Jacquet.

1387
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:27,259
Hello, sir.

1388
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:30,220
Get out.
Leave me alone.

1389
01:37:30,846 --> 01:37:33,139
- Get out!
- Is it me?

1390
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:34,432
Not at all.

1391
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,310
He got up in a bad mood.
Well, got up...

1392
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:40,772
"He got up..."

1393
01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:43,233
What a prick. Asshole.

1394
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:46,027
Driss Bassari.

1395
01:37:46,736 --> 01:37:47,737
Your turn.

1396
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:05,505
You got your license a month ago?

1397
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:07,257
I'd driven before.

1398
01:38:08,133 --> 01:38:11,303
Mostly on private roads, tracks,

1399
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:14,764
estates, parking lots.
I'm a good driver.

1400
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:20,020
I read your application.

1401
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:23,690
You used one word
to describe yourself: Pragmatic.

1402
01:38:23,982 --> 01:38:24,983
Yes.

1403
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:27,485
That's important.

1404
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:31,031
There's another idea here
that you forgot to mention.

1405
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:32,407
Really?

1406
01:38:33,617 --> 01:38:36,369
Maybe you should consider
reading our slogan.

1407
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:38,079
That's an alexandrine.

1408
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:39,706
I'm sorry?

1409
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:41,791
May-be you should

1410
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:45,253
con-si-der read-ing our slo-gan.
Twelve feet.

1411
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:47,839
It wasn't deliberate.

1412
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,300
"In time and on time."

1413
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:54,429
And you have Dali's melting clocks
for the artistic side.

1414
01:38:55,722 --> 01:38:56,806
Maybe, yes.

1415
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,268
Do you like art?

1416
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,645
Yes.

1417
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:03,813
- I like Michelangelo.
- Not bad.

1418
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,149
But I prefer the other Turtles.

1419
01:39:18,745 --> 01:39:19,746
I'm coming!

1420
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,165
Just a second!

1421
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,337
Are you OK?

1422
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:30,173
Get the hell out.

1423
01:39:31,091 --> 01:39:32,842
Some water? A compress?

1424
01:39:35,512 --> 01:39:36,513
Get out.

1425
01:39:38,974 --> 01:39:40,266
Get out!

1426
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:49,734
Thanks, Bruno.

1427
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:51,403
Have a good weekend.

1428
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:52,862
See you on Monday.

1429
01:39:53,822 --> 01:39:54,739
What's wrong?

1430
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:56,157
He's in a bad way.

1431
01:39:57,242 --> 01:40:00,036
- Where is he?
- Just now, he was in the garden.

1432
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,886
Hey, what's up, bro?

1433
01:40:18,263 --> 01:40:19,889
What's with the beard?

1434
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:22,809
Serpico?

1435
01:40:22,976 --> 01:40:24,019
Jean Jaurès?

1436
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:25,812
A metro station anyhow.

1437
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:26,980
Victor Hugo?

1438
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,608
You've let yourself go.

1439
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,360
Good thing I'm back.

1440
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:33,611
I'll be right in.

1441
01:41:27,874 --> 01:41:29,209
What do we do now?

1442
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,753
You let me handle it now.

1443
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:18,443
Not bad, huh?

1444
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:43,176
A quick cut would settle it.

1445
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:47,096
You're in great shape. I love it.

1446
01:43:50,683 --> 01:43:53,603
OK, you can open your eyes now.

1447
01:43:54,187 --> 01:43:55,313
That's hideous.

1448
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:56,856
It's hideous!

1449
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:58,942
- Horrible.
- It suits you.

1450
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:00,109
No.

1451
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,613
Look! Sleeveless leather vest,

1452
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:06,741
spiked bracelet,
Village People style cap.

1453
01:44:06,908 --> 01:44:09,327
Got it! Freddie Mercury!

1454
01:44:09,494 --> 01:44:11,537
You look just like him!

1455
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:14,624
That's wicked.
You look like an orthodox priest.

1456
01:44:14,791 --> 01:44:15,792
Or a Cossack!

1457
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:20,046
Come on!

1458
01:44:21,631 --> 01:44:23,258
He's crazy.

1459
01:44:23,424 --> 01:44:25,134
What are you doing?

1460
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:27,929
I expect the worst.

1461
01:44:28,137 --> 01:44:29,430
No, this one's good. Look.

1462
01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:34,435
My grandfather.

1463
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:35,687
Really?

1464
01:44:36,062 --> 01:44:38,773
Philippe, this mustache of yours,

1465
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:40,858
it really turns me on.

1466
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:42,402
I'll shave it all off.

1467
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:43,987
- Thank you.
- All right.

1468
01:44:45,697 --> 01:44:47,824
No, that's not funny.

1469
01:44:50,827 --> 01:44:52,036
<i>Nein!</i>

1470
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:53,413
That's what you mean.

1471
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:55,164
No, I don't agree.

1472
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:58,793
Philippe, very angry.

1473
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,170
I'm just your plaything now.

1474
01:45:02,171 --> 01:45:04,340
You'll end up in the loony bin.

1475
01:45:04,507 --> 01:45:06,843
Don't you feel like starting a war?

1476
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:11,180
I think it's time
to shave all this off now.

1477
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:13,308
You're having fun?

1478
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:16,060
You bet. How about Nazi invalids?

1479
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,938
It must have been weird
saluting like this.

1480
01:45:21,691 --> 01:45:24,569
You've had your fun now.
Get rid of it.

1481
01:45:37,165 --> 01:45:39,083
A booking in the name of Bassari.

1482
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:40,793
Table number eight.

1483
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:41,961
Follow me, please.

1484
01:45:47,759 --> 01:45:48,885
This way.

1485
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:14,243
I'm not staying for lunch, Philippe.

1486
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:18,373
- Why not?
- But you won't be alone.

1487
01:46:19,582 --> 01:46:22,877
Actually, you have a date.

1488
01:46:23,252 --> 01:46:24,754
A date?

1489
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:26,005
What's going on?

1490
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:29,133
Don't panic. It'll be fine.

1491
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:32,345
Only this time, you can't split.

1492
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:35,723
By the way...

1493
01:46:37,392 --> 01:46:38,976
...it took me a while,

1494
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:40,395
but I found it.

1495
01:46:41,229 --> 01:46:42,939
Give her a kiss for me.

1496
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:45,274
Driss!

1497
01:46:47,235 --> 01:46:48,236
Driss!

1498
01:46:51,197 --> 01:46:53,574
What's this all about?

1499
01:47:13,428 --> 01:47:14,554
Hello, Philippe.

1500
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:58,264
Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo
now lives in Morocco.

1501
01:47:58,431 --> 01:48:01,851

and has two young daughters.

1502
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:10,985
Abdel Sellou has his own firm.
He is married, with three children.

1503
01:48:29,629 --> 01:48:34,383
Philippe and Abdel are still very close.
