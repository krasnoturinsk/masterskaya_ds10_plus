says it is possible to buy the life of a

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,610
cop

125
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,440

about the jungle he knew the meaning of

150
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:23,889
every sound in the trees of every song

151
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:27,880
of the birds of every splash in the

152
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,930
water he learnt to climb trees like a

153
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,490
monkey

154
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,940
to swim in the rivers like a fish and to

155
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,270
hunt for his food as cleverly as any

156
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,860
animal in the jungle

157
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,250
chapter 2 the monkey-people

158
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,060
bar loo the old brown bear loved

159
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,060
teaching Mowgli

160
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,800
he taught him how to speak to the

161
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,769
different jungle people and he taught

162
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:22,240
him the important master words but

163
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,480
Mowgli sometimes got bored with all the

164
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,379
lessons one day when he was not

165
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:33,670
listening Baloo hit him very softly on

166
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:39,629
the head and Mowgli ran away angrily

167
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:43,779
Bagheera the Black Panther was not happy

168
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:49,149
about this remember how small he is he

169
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:50,279
said to Baloo

170
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,880
how can his little head hold all your

171
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,709
long words these words we keep him safe

172
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:03,310
from the birds from the snake people and

173
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,380
all the animals that hunt said Baloo it

174
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,420
is true that he is only small but no one

175
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,800
will hurt him if he remembers all the

176
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,389
master words come my ugly he called into

177
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:28,079
the trees come and say the words again

178
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,689
Mowgli climbed down from a tree and came

179
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:35,350
to sit next to them I will say the words

180
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,540

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,480
Mowgli said the same words but with the

187
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,259
sound of a bird now for the snake people

188
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,110
said Baloo

189
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:22,240
Mowgli then made the long sound which

190
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,209
was like no other noise only the noise

191
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:32,559
of a snake good said Baloo gently one

192
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,209
day you will thank me for my lessons now

193
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:41,199
you will be safe in the jungle because

194
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,319
no snake no bird no animal will hurt you

195
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:50,829
you do not need to be afraid of anyone

196
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:55,360
and I shall have my people and go with

197
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,670
them high up in the trees shouted Mowgli

198
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,360
what did you say Mowgli asked Baloo

199
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,009
surprised have you been with the

200
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:14,439
bandar-log the monkey people Mowgli

201
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,860
could hear that Baloo was angry and he

202
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,949
saw to that Bagheera's green eyes were

203
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:23,730
cold and hard

204
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,819
when Baloo hurt my head said Mowgli I

205
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:32,170
went away and the grey monkeys came down

206
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,769
from the trees and talked to me they

207
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,769
were kind to me and gave me nice things

208
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:43,089
to eat then they took me up into the

209
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,990
trees they said that I was their brother

210
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,470
and they wanted me to be their leader

211
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,970
one day why have you never told me about

212
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,559
the monkey people bad old Baloo they

213
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,610
play all day and don't do lessons

214
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,559
and I will play with them again

215
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:13,809
listen man-cub said baloo angrily i have

216
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,130
taught you the law for all the jungle

217
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,170
people but not for the monkey people

218
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,119
they have no law their ways are not our

219
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,910
ways they are noisy and dirty and they

220
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,600
think that they are a great people but

221
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,790
then they forget everything the rest of

222
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,260
the jungle people do not talk to them or

223
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,950
even think about them remember what I

224
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,760
tell you now Glee listened and was sorry

225
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,390
but all this time the bandar-log were

226
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,360
above them in the trees listening and

227
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,840
watching

228
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,299
they followed Mowgli and his friends

229
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,929
through the jungle until it was time for

230
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:16,470
the midday rest

231
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,740
Mowgli lay between his friends and went

232
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,780
to sleep

233
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,710
saying I will never talk to or play with

234
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,929
the monkey people again when he woke up

235
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:34,840
he was high in a tree and there were

236
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,240
hands holding his legs and arms hard

237
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,220
strong little hands down below Baloo was

238
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,299
shouting angrily and Bagheera was trying

239
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:52,870
to climb up the tree but he was too

240
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,100
heavy for the thin branches the monkeys

241
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,910
shouting and laughing carried Mowgli

242
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,960
between them and began their journey

243
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,929
along the monkey roads which are high in

244
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,590
the trees

245
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,760
it was a wild exciting journey

246
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,090
the

247
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,590
he's jumped from treetop to treetop

248
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,950
crashing through the leaves and branches

249
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,910
at first Mowgli was afraid of falling

250
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:32,890
but then he began to think he must tell

251
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:38,260
Baloo and Bagheera where he was high up

252
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:44,110
in the blue sky he saw chil the kite the

253
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,690
Big Bird saw that the monkeys were

254
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,020
carrying a man-cub

255
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,410
he flew down to look and was surprised

256
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,700
to hear the bird call of the kites we

257
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:04,350
are of one blood you and I who are you

258
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:10,810
called chill Mowgli the man-cub came the

259
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,220
reply watch where they take me and tell

260
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,260
Baloo and Bagheera

261
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:23,860
I will cold chill and he flew high above

262
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,350
the trees and watched with his

263
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:32,500
far-seeing eyes monkeys can travel fast

264
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,340
when they want to and by now Baloo and

265
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,560
Bagheera what a long way behind we

266
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,010
cannot follow the bandar-log through the

267
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,870
trees said Baloo and we will never catch

268
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:55,690
them but they are afraid of ah the big

269
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,610
Python he can climb as easily as the

270
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,590
monkeys and he eats them perhaps he will

271
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:11,740
help us and so Baloo and Bagheera went

272
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:17,230
to look for car the Python they found

273
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,440
him lying in the Sun ten

274
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,080

275
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:35,330
dangerous watch news cult car when he

276
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,400
saw them we are looking for food said

277
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,450
baloo he knew that you must not hurry

278
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,310
car he is too big

279
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:53,590
let me come with you said car hungrily I

281
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:07,400
the bandar-log said baloo those noisy

282
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,660
dirty thieves have stolen our man-cub

283
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:19,040
and we love our man-cub very much the

284
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,780
bandar-log said Bagheera cleverly are

285
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:28,520
very much afraid of you car but they say

286
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,300
bad things about you and call you old

287
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:43,670
yellow fish I hear sidqa I will teach

290
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,440
tired of him quickly and that is bad for

291
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:07,070
him up up look up Baloo Baloo looked up

292
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:12,280
and saw chil the kind high in the sky

293
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,070
what is it called Baloo

294
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,500
I have seen Mowgli the man-cub with the

295
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,440
bandar-log he knew the master word they

296
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,640
have taken him to the monkey City the

297
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,750
lost

298
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:38,150
City baloo and bagheera

299
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,980
new of the monkey city men lived there

300
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,130
once but they left hundreds of years ago

301
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,190
nobody went there now only the

302
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,900
bandar-log we must leave at once

303
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:03,620
said bagheera it is a long way I will

304
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,570
come as fast as I can said Baloo but you

305
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:17,140
and car can go faster I will follow you

306
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:22,630
the lost city was very old

307
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,480
there were many beautiful buildings but

308
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,480
the walls were broken and full of holes

309
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,680
and there were tall trees in houses that

310
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,990
were now open to the sky the monkey

311
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,160
people called the place their City and

312
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,710
ran around everywhere

313
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,950
inland out of the empty houses up and

314
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,530
down the fruit trees in the old gardens

315
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,100
now Mowgli was in their City and the

316
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,040
monkey people were very pleased with

317
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,530
themselves

318
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,670
this boy can help us they said he can

319
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,970
teach us how to make things because men

320
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:17,000
are clever with their hands but monkeys

321
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,870
make many plans and always forget them

322
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,580
five minutes later

323
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,609
when Mowgli arrived in the city he was

324
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:33,919
tired and hungry bring me food he said

325
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,359
and twenty or thirty monkeys ran to

326
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:41,509
bring him fruit but they started

327
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:44,570
fighting and forgot to take any fruit

328
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,460
back to Mowgli Mowgli knew that he was

329
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,840
in a bad place

330
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,590
Ballu was right he thought the

331
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,520
bandar-log have no law and their ways

332
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,150
are not our ways I must try to get away

333
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,690
Baloo will surely be angry with me but

334
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,179
that is better than life with the

335
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:18,270
bandar-log but when Mowgli went to the

336
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,929
walls of the city the monkeys pulled him

337
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:27,750
back you are very happy here with us we

338
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:33,840
are great we are wonderful we all say so

339
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,289
and so it is true they shouted don't

340
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:45,750
they ever sleep thought Mowgli he looked

341
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,010
up at the sky there's a cloud coming

342
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,559
over the moon

343
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:56,330
perhaps I can run away when it's dark

344
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:00,740
but I am tired

345
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,910
Chapter three

346
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,420
Karl's hunting

347
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,290
Bagheera and car were also watching that

348
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,510
cloud

349
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:33,050
they were now outside the city walls but

350
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:36,800
they knew they had to be careful there

351
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
were only two of them and there were

352
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,230
hundreds of monkeys they are over there

353
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,570
by that house talking about the boy said

354
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,810
Bagheera when the cloud hides the moon I

355
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:01,040
will attack them I will go to the higher

356
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,160
ground at the west war Cassatt and come

357
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,470
down the hill very fast

358
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:18,560
good hunting the Black Panther ran

359
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,220
quickly to the crowds of monkeys and

360
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,910
started hitting right and left as hard

361
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,730
as he could

362
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:32,540
the monkeys screamed angrily but then

363
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,800
one of them shouted there is only one

364
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,950
here kill him kill and a crowd of

365
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,350
monkeys jumped on Bagheera biting and

366
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:52,490
pulling another group pulled Mowgli up a

367
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,690
wall and pushed him over he fell down

368
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,710
into a dark room which had no doors or

369
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,360
windows and he could not get out stay

370
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,460
there

371
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,160
shouted the monkeys until we have killed

372
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,420
your friend and then we will play with

373
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:22,910
you if the snakes leave you alive Mowgli

374
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,390
and he seems

375
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,940
in the darkness around him we are of one

376
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,100
blood you and I he said quickly giving

377
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:43,860
the snakes call the snakes replied we

378
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,809
will not bite you but stand still little

379
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:55,160
brother because your feet can hurt us

380
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:00,419
Mowgli stood very still and listened to

381
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:05,280
the fight around Bagheera for the first

382
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,750
time ever the big Panther was fighting

383
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,740
for his life

384
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:18,059
then Mowgli remembered something there

385
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,660
was a big tank of water near one of the

386
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:27,690
buildings go to the tank Bagheera get to

387
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,169
the water

388
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,080
Bagheera heard and he knew that Mowgli

389
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,929
was safe

390
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:40,739
suddenly he felt stronger and he pulled

391
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,799
himself slowly to the tank fighting

392
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,089
against the crowds of monkeys

393
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:51,359
then Baloo came running in from the

394
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:59,099
jungle shouting Bagheera I am here at

395
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:03,210
once the monkeys jumped on him and the

396
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,299
bear started to hit them with his great

397
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,049
strong arms

398
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:13,169
Mowgli heard a splash when Bagheera

399
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:17,580
jumped into the tank the monkeys were

400
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,879
afraid of water and could not follow him

401
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:25,049
there but they stood all round the sides

402
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,679
ready to jump on him if he tried to get

403
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:35,729
out and help Baloo and where was car all

404
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:40,440

west wall and car moved carefully over

406
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,440
the stones now he came down the hill

407
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,859

409
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:05,249
he went silently into the crowd of

410
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:09,779
monkeys around Baloo and he did not need

411
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:15,919
to hit twice when they are very young

412
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,129

489
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,260
all this man-cub was because you played

490
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:54,830
with the bandar-log it is true said

491
00:38:54,830 --> 00:39:00,710
Mowgli sadly I am a bad man cub the law

492
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,180
of the jungle says we must punish you

493
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,990
said Bagheera Baloo was happy that

494
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,710
Mowgli was safe and with them again but

495
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,390
he could not speak against the law it is

496
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,040
right

497
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,400
to punish me said Mowgli I did wrong

498
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,780
Bagheera hit him very softly for a

499
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,020
panther but very heavily for a little

500
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:39,600
boy Mowgli did not cry now said Bagheera

501
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,110
jump on my back little brother and we

502
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:50,020
will go home one of the good things

503
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,950
about jungle law is that after you were

504
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:59,100
punished the matter is finished

505
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:17,579
chapter four the fight of the rock

506
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,000
Mowgli always went to the meetings of

507
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,210
the Wolfpack and there he learned

508
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:32,160
something new one day if he looked hard

509
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,839
at any wolf the wolf could not meet his

510
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,790
eyes and looked away

511
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:45,030
Mowgli thought this was funny he did not

512
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,849
understand that he was different from

513
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:51,839
the wolves all the jungle people were

514
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:56,690
his friends but not sheer Khan of course

515
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,060
mother wolf told him that the tiger

516
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,220
wanted to kill him one day you must kill

517
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:11,400
Shere Khan if you don't kill him he will

518
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,099
kill you but Mowgli forgot he was only a

519
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,020
boy not a wolf

520
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,510
Shaya Khan's still came often to that

521
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,710
part of the jungle are kala was older

522
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,579
now and not so strong and Shere Khan

523
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:35,099
made friends with some of the younger

524
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,710
wolves our kala could not stop them and

525
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,200
Shiah Khan began to make trouble for

526
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,579
Mowgli I hear you can't look into the

527
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:54,869
mancubs eyes he said laughing to the

528
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:58,560
young wolves and the young wolves began

529
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,079
to get angry Bagheera who had eyes and

530
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,460
ears everywhere

531
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,010
knew something of this and told Mowgli

532
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:15,930
Mowgli laughed but Bagheera went on open

533
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:19,980
your eyes little brother remember that

534
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,940
our kala is old and he will not always

535
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:29,970
be the leader of the pack Shere Khan has

536
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,660
taught the younger wolves

537
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:36,000
but a man-cub has no place with them and

538
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,680
soon you will be a man not a man-cub but

539
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,799
the wolves are my brothers why will they

540
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:52,990
want to send me away look at me said

541
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,130
Bagheera and Mowgli looked at him hard

542
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,220
between the eyes

543
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,880
the big black cat turned his head away

544
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,890
quickly that is why he said not even I

545
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,940
can look in your eyes that is why they

546
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:19,539
want to kill you you are clever you are

547
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:25,569
a man I did not know these things said

548
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:31,420
Mowgli quietly now listen the day will

549
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,470
soon come when our kala cannot kill his

550
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:40,809

561
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:32,410
through the jungle to the village on his

562
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,819
way he heard the sounds of the Wolfpack

563
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:41,230

wolves kill it Mowgli stopped and

567
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:56,130
listened and he could hear that our kala

568
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:02,890
did not kill the deer so the time has

569
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:07,480

570
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,480
the village he watched and waited and

571
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,330
soon he saw a child who was carrying a

572
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:21,550
fire pot Mowgli jumped up took the pot

573
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,030
from him and quickly ran away back to

574
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:29,920
the jungle all that day he kept his fire

575
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,430
alive with leaves and pieces of wood in

576
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:40,089
the evening taboc we came and told him

577
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:42,910
that the Wolves wanted him at the

578
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,400
meeting

579
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,940
Mowgli laughed and went when he arrived

580
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,400
he saw that our kala was not in his

581
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,690
special place on top of the rock but

582
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:03,520
beside it that meant that another wolf

583
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,320
could try to take our Kayla's place she

584
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,070
akong was there too with all the younger

585
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:16,900
wolves around him Mowgli sat down with

586
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,320
the firebot between his legs

587
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:25,690
Bagheera lay beside him Shere Khan began

588
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:31,300

592
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,980
the other wolf said let our kala speak

593
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,890

594
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,060

600
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:47,280
no one spoke our kala was old but nobody

601
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,720
wanted to fight our kala alone

602
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,550

625
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:44,360
afraid and moved back Mowgli held a long

626
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,510
piece of wood in the fire and the end

627
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:52,370

00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:45,320

644
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,850
Mowgli jumped at the young wolves with

645
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,800
his burning stick and they all ran away

646
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,100

00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,530
Bagheera and a few older wolves left

648
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:35,210

668
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,610
morning Mowgli went down the hill alone

669
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:14,370
to meet those strange things that are

670
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:18,050
called men

671
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,160

00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:47,040
enemies now and he went far away he ran

674
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,170
until he came to a village in a place

675
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:54,180
with many rocks and narrow valleys

676
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,869
everywhere mouth Lee could see cows and

677
00:53:57,869 --> 00:54:01,660
buffaloes some little boys were looking

678
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,780
after the cows but when they saw Mowgli

679
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,030
they shouted and ran away

680
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:12,490
Mowgli walked on until he came to the

681
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:18,820
village he sat down by the gate when a

682
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,730
man came out of the village Mowgli

683
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,790
opened his mouth to show that he wanted

684
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:29,200
food the man ran back into the village

685
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,050
and came back with a hundred other

686
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:35,800
people they all looked at mao glee and

687
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,800
saw the bite marks on his arms and legs

688
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:46,240
look said a man those are the bite marks

689
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,190
of wolves he is a wolf child who has run

690
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,000
away from the jungle he is a

691
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,560
good-looking boy said one of the women

692
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,260
messua he looks like your little boy

693
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:07,200
that was taken by the tiger let me look

694
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,600
said Masuya yes he is thin but he looks

695
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,290
like my son take him to your house

696
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:21,580
mizuha the villager said the jungle took

697
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,640
your boy and the jungle has given you

698
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,660
this one back

699
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,640
woman called masseur took my ugly to her

700
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,440
house and gave him milk and bread

701
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,870
this was Mowgli's first time in a house

702
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:43,190
and he did not like it it felt like a

703
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:48,410
prison but I am a man now he thought and

704
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:53,330
I must do what men do I must also learn

705
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:59,300
to speak like men he knew all the many

706
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,540
languages of the jungle and so it was

707
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,920
easy for him to learn the sounds of men

708
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,740
that first evening he learned many words

709
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,860
from masseur but that night he did not

710
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,730
want to sleep inside the house so he

711
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,730
climbed out of the window and went to

712
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:27,350
sleep in a field near the village before

713
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:31,100
he went to sleep a soft grey nose

714
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:36,170
touched his face it was grey brother the

715
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:41,510
eldest of mother Wolf's Cubs wake little

716
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:47,000
brother he said I bring news Xie Kahn

717
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,650

718
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:55,490
the red flower but he says that when he

719
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:58,700
comes back he will kill you

720
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:03,680
I remember also what I said about Shere

721
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,090
Khan said Mowgli but it is good to have

722
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:12,050

723
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:17,270
brother yes little brother but you will

00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:20,720
not forget that you are a wolf you will

725
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,250
not forget us when you are with men

726
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:28,370
never replied Mowgli I will always

727
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:35,550
remember that I love you all for three

728
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:39,940
Mowgli learned how to be like a man he

729
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,090
had to wear clothes learn how to use

730
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:48,220
money and how to work in the fields in

731
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,980
the evenings he sat with the villagers

732
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:54,790
under a great tree while the men told

733
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:58,650
stories about the jungle and the animals

734
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:03,550
once when Buldeo the village hunter told

735
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,060
a story about a tiger

736
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,730
Mowgli had to hide his face because he

737
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:14,500
was laughing at the end he said full day

738
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,950
of stories are stupid he knows nothing

739
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:22,930
about the jungle the villagers did not

740
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:26,440
like this and after that they sent

741
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,500
Mowgli out every day with the other boys

742
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,380
to look after the herds of cows and

743
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:37,360
buffaloes while they ate Mowgli enjoyed

744
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,620
this work and usually went on alone with

745
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:46,150
a big group of cows and buffaloes one

746
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:49,450
day he saw a grey brother under a tree

747
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,840
near the jungle

748
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,140
Shaya khan has come back but he is

749
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:00,610

there was nobody at the dock tree then

757
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:34,900

759
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,230

the ravine after a meal he cannot fight

779
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:08,970
or climb easily but I need a big group

780
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:11,670

01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:16,619
to stop him escaping then we will catch

Buffaloes round in a big circle uphill

803
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:40,430

01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:44,980
want Shere Khan to hear them at last

805
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:50,330

down the ravine faster and faster and

813
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:25,300
the ground shook under their heavy feet

815
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,620

01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:37,280
down the ravine no Tiger can hope to

817
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,640
stand against a herd of buffaloes when

they are moving fast he looked for a way

819
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,350
to escape but the ravine was narrow with

826
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:15,870
running down a mountain the Buffaloes

827
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:19,230
