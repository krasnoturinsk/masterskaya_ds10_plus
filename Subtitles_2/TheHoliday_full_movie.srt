women with pre-holiday psychosis

248
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,720

hallucinating and talking to people who

802
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,800
adorable son

were you spying on me i mean is that

804
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
what you were doing

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,440
let's just focus on why you're here okay

806
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,280
explain to me exactly what that means

807
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,520
well um in 1997 mr phipps had previously

808
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,440
signed for a considerable loan to make

809
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,079
some repairs on a very costly estate

810
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,000
well the bank set up a balloon note

811
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,440
which means monthly payments would be

812
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,000
made until the end of the note on which

813
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,160
the remaining balance would be paid a

814
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,640
balance of 30 000 dollars

815
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,040
miss phipps balloon notes are very

816
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,960
common in this industry i'm sure mr

817
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,560
phipps was well aware of the contract he

818
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,800
was getting himself into

819
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
okay so i mean what do we do we need to

820
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,640
sign another loan to cover this one

821
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,880
unfortunately at this time there are no

822
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,960
loan options available

823
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,040
the bank is gonna have to do whatever

824
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,640
necessary to recoup its losses

825
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,400
take my house

826
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
i mean

827
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,920
the house is worth more than that stupid

828
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,400
loan miss phipps the note clearly

829
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,560
specifies that the estate was used as

830
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,800
collateral so

831
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,599
can i set up some kind of payment plan

832
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,480
as the notice clearly states you have

833
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,520
until december 24th

834
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,160
to pay back the full amount owed

835
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,079
or the bank will have no other option

836
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,720
but to take full possession

837
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,760
of the estate on december 25th

838
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,800
christmas day

839
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,760
you heartless slime ball

840
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,320
it's not personal to you because it's

841
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
not misplacing your keys to your fancy

842
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,280
car or getting a stain on your nice suit

843
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,380

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,040
out for me

loneliness

we didn't have much

993
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,680
but she would remind me that we're rich

994
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,839
because we have each other

995
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,920
i know that sounds lame but i mean it

996
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,680

know

998
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,200
sounds a lot like my dad

999
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,599
she taught me to never stop fighting for

1000
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,920
the things i care about

1001
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,880

i really thought this was it

1754
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,400
this was the reason i found myself in

1755
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,000
this little town

1756
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,440
it was to meet you

01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,380
whoever you were

that maybe destiny was real

1760
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,760
that maybe if if i put myself out there

1761
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,000
we would find each other

1762
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,760
but i want you to know that whether

1763
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,440
you're real or not

1764
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,239
i believe in what could have been

1765
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,560
the thought that one day we would meet

1766
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,719
and realize we had just been looking for

1767
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,040
each other

1768
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,880
our whole lives we were just trying to

1769
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,800
find

01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,800

since i don't know who you are or where

1776
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,840

soon to be revealed

1910
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,040
